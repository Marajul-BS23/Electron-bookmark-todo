electron-quick-start
Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.

This is a minimal Electron application based on the Quick Start Guide within the Electron documentation.

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

package.json - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
main.js - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's main process.
index.html - A web page to render. This is the app's renderer process.
You can learn more about each of these components within the Quick Start Guide.
